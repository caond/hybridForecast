\title{hybridForecast: A Hybrid Time Series Forecasting Package}
\description{
This package provides a modular, ensemble-based framework for time series forecasting.
It supports trend-seasonal decomposition, lag-based feature engineering, multiple machine learning models
(e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM, torch), and ensemble selection based on cross-validated accuracy.
}
\section{Main Functions}{

- \code{\link{hybrid}}: Fit a hybrid forecasting model.
- \code{\link{predict_hybrid}}: Forecast future values using a trained hybrid model.
- \code{\link{plot.hybrid_train}}: Visualize CV training folds.
- \code{\link{simulate_time_series}}: Simulate time series with seasonal and changepoint components.
}

\examples{
# Simulate a time series
data <- simulate_time_series(freq = "week", length_out = 156, seed = 42)

# Fit hybrid model
fit <- hybrid(data)

# Plot CV results
plot(fit)

# Predict future
future_df <- make_future_data(fit, horizon = 14)
forecast_hybrid <- predict(fit, future_df)
plot(forecast_hybrid)
